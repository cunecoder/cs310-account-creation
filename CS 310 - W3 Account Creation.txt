1. How did you invoke the useradd command-line tool?
    There is a python module called subprocess that I import. I then run a linux command through
    python like so: subprocess.run(['command', 'arg1', 'arg2']). To create a user account with
    the audio and video groups, I run this python command:
    subprocess.run(['sudo', 'useradd', '-m', '-G', 'audio,video', username])

2. How did you create the username value?
    I created it by using .lower() from the user's full name input. I then did string concatenation
    with a dash between the first and last name.
    e.g.
    name = input
    name = name.lower()
    name = name.split()
    username = str(name[0] + '-' + name[-1])
